# Two-community-phyto-model

This GitHub repository accompanies the manuscript of Brewin et al. titled “A conceptual approach to partitioning a vertical profile of phytoplankton biomass into contributions from two communities”. It includes a Jupyter notebook (Example_fits_for_2_community_vertical_model.ipynb) designed to illustrate how the model, developed in the paper, is fitted to data from a BGC-Argo float in (WMO 6901573) in the Northern Red Sea using Python coding language. This BGC-Argo float file 6901573\_Sprof.nc is available from the CORIOLIS (ifremer) data centres (ftp://ftp.ifremer.fr/ifremer/argo/dac/coriolis/) and has been uploaded to this GitHub repository for use in this example.

Regarding this data, we acknowledge the Remotely Sensed Biogeochemical Cycles in the Ocean (remOcean) project, funded by the European Research Council (GA 246777), and thank the Herve Claustre and all others involved in the deployment of the BGC-Argo float (WMO number 6901573). These data were collected and made freely available by the International Argo Program and the national programs that contribute to it (https://argo.ucsd.edu, https://www.ocean-ops.org). The Argo Program is part of the Global Ocean Observing System.

The notebook can be run through a webpage, just click on the launch-binder image.

In addition to this notebook, we provide a folder containing the code (Python and IDL scripts) used in the paper, to produce all figures in the paper.
