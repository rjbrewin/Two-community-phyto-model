# Two-community-phyto-model

This GitHub repository accompanies the manuscript of Brewin et al. titled “A conceptual approach to partitioning a vertical profile of phytoplankton biomass into contributions from two communities”. It includes a Jupyter notebook (Example_fits_for_2_community_vertical_model.ipynb) designed to illustrate how the model, developed in the paper, is fitted to data from a BGC-Argo float in (WMO 6901573) in the Northern Red Sea using Python coding language. This BGC-Argo float file 6901573'\_Sprof.nc is available from the CORIOLIS (ifremer) data centres (ftp://ftp.ifremer.fr/ifremer/argo/dac/coriolis/) and has been uploaded to this GitHub repository for use in this example.

The notebook can be run through a webpage, just click on the launch-binder image.
